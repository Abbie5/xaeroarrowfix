## Xaero Arrow Fix

Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaero-arrow-fix) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeroarrowfix)

This mod fixes a bug in Xaero's Minimap where, when the main entity is displayed as an arrow, either by selecting it in the settings or using the "lock minimap north" option, the main entity dot is still displayed in the centre of the map.
